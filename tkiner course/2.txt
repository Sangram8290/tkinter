Maharana Pratap took refuge in the Chappan area and started attacking the Mughal strongholds. \nBy 1583 he had successfully captured western Mewar, \nwhich included Dewar, Amet, Madariya, Zawar and the fort of Kumbalgarh. He then 

made Chavand his capital and constructed a \nChamunda mata temple there. The Maharana was able to live in peace for a short time and started \nestablishing order in Mewar. From 1585 till his death, the Rana had recovered \na large part of 

Mewar. The citizens who had migrated out of Mewar \nstarted returning during this time. There was good monsoon which elped to revive the 

agriculture of Mewar. The economy also \nstarted getting better and trade in the area started 

increasing. The Rana was able to capture the \nterritories west of Chittor but could not fulfill his \ndream of capturing 
Chittor itself
